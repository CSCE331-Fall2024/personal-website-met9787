        <h1>Service Section</h1>
        <p>This semester, I will be volunteering as a staff member for The Big Event, which is an annual school-wide volunteering event in which hundreds of students come together to volunteer and help out local communities. This could be by building things, cleaning outside areas, or just doing other smaller favors. I am excited to not just volunteer, but be a staff member for the event and coordinate the activities. I am also trying to join a social service organization for my university, in which we do similar acts of service as in The Big Event.</p>
        <p>I have a strong passion for helping people and seeing the joy on people’s faces when their lives get better. I plan on trying to become a teacher at some point in the future, so I can help hundreds of students’ lives in whatever ways I am able to help.</p>
