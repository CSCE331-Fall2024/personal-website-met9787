            <h1>Technical Skills</h1>
            <p>Currently, I am proficient in C++, C, and Python, and have significant experience with Haskell, Java, Assembly, and HTML/CSS. I personally believe I excel more in front-end development, but I try to see projects as opportunities to learn how to do new things, so I'd be happy to tackle any problem.</p>
            <h1>Areas of Interest</h1>
            <p>The aspects of Computer Science that I am the most interested in are game development, website development, and general front-end programming. I love the idea of being able to directly interact with a visually appealing or entertaining element of my code. I spent a lot of time playing video games when I was younger as well, so the thought of getting to recreate some of the magic they instilled in me is something that I look forward to making into a reality.</p>
