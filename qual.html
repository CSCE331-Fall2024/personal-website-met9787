            <h1>Technical Skills</h1>
            <p>Currently, I am proficient in C++, C, and Python, and have significant experience with Haskell, Java, Assembly, and HTML/CSS. I personally believe I excel more in front-end development, but I try to see projects as opportunities to learn how to do new things, so I'd be happy to tackle any problem.</p>
            <p>Here is my Resume:</p>

            <h1>Areas of Interest</h1>
            <p>The aspects of Computer Science that I am the most interested in are game development, website development, and general front-end programming. I love the idea of being able to directly interact with a visually appealing or entertaining element of my code. I spent a lot of time playing video games when I was younger as well, so the thought of getting to recreate some of the magic they instilled in me is something that I look forward to making into a reality.</p>
            <p> I love being able to express myself creatively through a variety of mediums, and both coding and music allow me to do just that. Coding isn’t something I’ve been doing for very long, but I have found it very enjoyable, interesting, and challenging as I’ve become more proficient. I am constantly fascinated by the ability to make whatever you can think of just by getting better with programming. </p>
            <p>Music, on the other hand, is something that I’ve been in touch with for as long as I can remember. I’ve been playing mostly percussion instruments for over a decade, even becoming a Texas All-State Percussionist my senior year of high school. I have made multiple pieces of music, including solo performances and a percussion ensemble piece. I also was a part of a very talented band and percussion program, where we performed various marching band shows and award-winning drumline shows.</p>
            <p>Here is a link to a marimba solo that I wrote, as well as the YouTube Channel of my high school percussion program.</p>
