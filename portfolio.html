            <h1>Personality Test</h1>
            <p>I coded a personality test using Python. The layout involved the user being asked a series of 38 carefully selected yes or no questions. Then, based on the answers of the user, the test would return 9 different personality and character traits, with the intent to be as accurate as possible. The test would also return a percentage for each of these 9 traits, which would show how strongly each trait can be applied to the user.</p>
            <h1>Game Design</h1>
            <p>Currently, I am beginning the process of creating a video game. This is a group project for a school club, in which we will be working together to create the art style, narrative, code, music, and overall design for a video game.</p>
            <p>Here is the link to my GitHub, where I plan on posting future coding projects that I want to share with the world.</p>
