            <p>Hi! My name is Mario, and I am a junior Computer Science major at Texas A&M University. I am in the University Honors program, a member of the TAMU Game Design Club, and was a member of the Texas A&M Wind Symphony for two years. I love being able to express myself creatively through a variety of mediums, and both coding and music allow me to do just that.</p>
            <p>Coding isn’t something I’ve been doing for very long, but I have found it very enjoyable, interesting, and challenging as I’ve become more proficient. Music, on the other hand, is something that I’ve been in touch with for as long as I remember. I’ve been playing mostly percussion instruments for over a decade, even becoming a Texas All-State Percussionist my senior year of high school.</p>
            <p>I have made multiple pieces of music, including solo performances and a percussion ensemble piece. I also was a part of a very talented band and percussion program, where we performed various marching band shows and award-winning drumline shows. Here is a link to a marimba solo that I wrote, as well as the YouTube Channel of my high school percussion program.</p>
